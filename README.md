```
My boy
He ain't up to much
My boy
He ain't in to love
My boy
He don't get all dressed up
He don't get a second glance

My boy
His head is in the clouds
He just leaves it all to chance
But when he calls
I always say
Come on over

We can dance
Oh, we can dance
Oh, we can dance
Oh, we can dance

My boy
He ain't up to much
My boy
He ain't in to love
My boy
He don't get all dressed up
He don't get a second glance

But when he calls
I always say
Come on over

We can dance
Oh, we can dance
Oh, we can dance
Oh, we can dance

We can dance
Oh, we can dance
Oh, we can dance
Oh, we can dance
